# Cappy's Website

Hi I'm Cappy, welcome to my personal website.

You may also know me by my legally assigned name of **Pornpipat Popum**.

I mostly write in **Rust**, and occasionally in **Python** and **JavaScript**/**Typescript**. Sometimes bare metal hardware
if I could afford materials.

Big [Ado](https://www.universal-music.co.jp/ado/) fan.

My expertise is mostly in backend and systems stuff. I don't really do web development (see below).

## Notable stuff I did

- [Backflow](https://github.com/FyraLabs/backflow) - a (somewhat) high-performance networked input routing framework
  and ephemeral message queue, designed to handle low-latency rapid-fire events
  - performance-tuned with rhythm games in mind
  - insane throughput (around ~100us per event)
  - modular 9P-style architecture for integration with external driver plugins.

  Events can be directly piped in or out of Backflow using a variety of protocols transparently, allowing any arbitrary
  integration with external hardware or software. Including standard I/O (stdio), UNIX Sockets, and WebSockets all with the same ABI

- [Ultramarine Linux] - Fedora-based Linux distribution spawned from frustration with Red Hat's FOSS packaging policies,
  now aims to be a user-friendly Fedora remix with a focus on out-of-the-box usability and software ecosystem

- [Terra] - RPM packages repository created as a supplementary repository for Ultramarine Linux,
  but also available for any Fedora-based distribution users to use.
  Contains a variety of software that is not available in Fedora's official repositories,
  Aims to be a partially-automated replacement for RPM Fusion.

- Some arcade bootleg scene stuff I probably can't get into publicly because the corporate ninjas will kill me, not that I care
  Let's just say Japanese IT infra is laughably outdated.

## FAQ

### What's this website built in?

This whole thing's built using Astro, TailwindCSS and some MDX (and some manual css rules). Mostly because I:

1. Don't like to write CSS rules
2. Still liked to write Markdown over HTML
3. Wanted a streamlined way to quickly convert all my Markdown into a static HTML site

that's it. that's literally it.

### Why?

I want to be lazy and also make my shit scale at the same time, in case I wanted to add more complex stuff,
but for now this shit is as basic as it gets

### What do you actually do?

I am the CIO (Chief Information Officer) of [Fyra Labs].

As you can see from this website, web design isn't my strong suit so I intentionally made this
website very minimal. This website is mostly just a formality :p

I usually do backend and stuff that involves networking and/or high performance code stuff. And also [Ultramarine Linux].


### What's your favorite color?

Blue. Teal maybe, mostly deep sky blue (`#00bfff`)

### What's your philosophy on life and/or work?

I tend to butt heads with the establishment on things, mostly because
I'm a firm believer in ***absolute epistemological freedom*** and open-source.

If software exists but never gets used because of artificial restrictions,
I see that as a failure of the system. I focus on making sure people can actually interact with and learn from software,
sometimes that means giving access in ways the vendors never intended ;)

for my views on ethical source, see [here](https://files.cappuchino.xyz/MANIFESTO.md). (tl;dr it's pointless)

For my view on life itself though, I'm a Buddhist by birth *and* practice, so uhh
if you want my interpretation on that, it's one acronym: YOLO.
